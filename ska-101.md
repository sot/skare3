# Ska 101

The Ska runtime environment is an integrated suite of Python and Perl packages and
associated applications. This environment is used in many facets of Chandra operations:

- Mission critical functions:
  - Mission planning
  - Load review
  - SOT MTA (Monitoring, trends, alerts)
  - Find attitude from full-field search stars
- SOT and FOT spacecraft and science instrument analysis
- SOT Aspect / ACA
  - Trending
  - Operations tools (find attitude, ACA image viewer)

Ska is supported on linux-64, Windows-64, and MacOS ARM-64. The SOT Ska team has primary
responsibility for the management, release, and deployment of the Ska runtime environment:
- Flight Ska (linux) maintained on HEAD and GRETA (chimchim and cheru) by the Ska team.
- MATLAB Ska (Windows) created by Ska team and is included in the MATLAB tools by the FOT.
- Standalone installations (linux, Mac, Windows) are managed by users.

Managing Ska requires substantial resources. The Ska team release manager maintains
numerous scripts and GitHub workflow actions for automated nightly integration testing
of all packages (in development), automated package building on target architectures,
documentation build and deployment, release documentation and deployment, and more.

### Package development
- Done by the Chandra operations community using open-source process on GitHub with
  thorough review of each change (Pull Request).
- Packages hosted at https://github.com/sot and https://github.com/acisops
  (ACIS-specific).

### Testing
- Most packages have unit tests that cover functionality.
- Changes require new unit tests or documented functional testing.
- Each night, `master` or `main` branch of all Ska packages are deployed to a `masters`
  Ska test environment. All unit tests are run along with addition functional
  integration tests.
- Results of integration testing are available in a web page app and failures reported
  in email.

## What's in Ska?

At the highest level Ska includes the following:
- Packages developed and maintained by Chandra operations (e.g. `xija` or `kadi`).
  - Known as the `ska3-flight` or `ska3-matlab` packages.
  - About 50 distinct packages.
  - Updated and released about 10 times per year.
- Off-the-shelf Packages from the open-source community (e.g. `numpy` or `matplotlib`).
  - Known as the `ska3-core` packages.
  - Nearly 500 distinct packages.
  - Normally updated once per year, including an update of the major Python version.
- Optional components:
  - Perl interpreter and various Perl packages.
  - "Non-FSDS" packages for processing, trending, etc. These get installed to the HEAD
    production environment but have different control authority.

## Getting help

### Documentation

Most flight Ska packages have online documentation that can be found at:
https://sot.github.io/.

#### Updates to cheta and kadi docs

Documentation for two key packages have been recently overhauled for both content and
theme. The goal is making the content more focused and accessible.
- https://sot.github.io/kadi
- https://sot.github.io/cheta

### Community support

Writing good documentation is difficult and time-consuming. If you have a
question that is not quickly answered by the online docs then **ASK THE COMMUNITY!!**.

The best approach is to ask on Slack in the `#analysis-coding` channel:

- Do not spend too much time struggling to figure something out.
- No question is too basic.
- Community "experts" genuinely enjoy answering code questions.
- If you are starting to write some basic utility, it may have already been written. Ask
  first!

Asking questions also helps us focus energy where needed on *improving* the docs.

### Use the Source, Luke

All the source code for Ska flight packages is available on GitHub at
https://github.com/sot. Caveat: Some packages (e.g. `parse_cm`, `maude`,
`chandra_maneuver`, `chandra_limits`) are private and visible only to the 20 `sot`
organization members.

This can be useful:
- Navigate to https://github.com/sot and then Search for a function.
- This should show both the function definition and examples of other code that uses it.

## Ska data latency

Ska depends on data products that are maintained largely via automated cron jobs that
run on HEAD linux machines. These data are then synced to GRETA (`chimchim`) on a daily
basis. Here we describe the timing of key cron jobs.

### Cheta telemetry archive

Cron processing to ingest CXC L0 telemetry starts at 4am local each morning and
generally finished by 6:30am. Typically, data from all previous comms will be available.
Processing finishes by updating the cheta sync archive which is used for maintaining a
local copy of the cheta archive.

When there is safe mode or other issue that significantly impacts the clock correlation,
then CXCDS processing waits for a new clock correlation. This can take several days, so
during that time the CXC L0 telemetry processing halts and cheta telemetry stops getting
updated.

### Kadi

#### Events

Kadi events depend on telemetry. Processing starts at 7am and finishes in a minute or
two.

**COMING SOON!!** -- kadi events will be updated on HEAD and GRETA within an hour of
data being available in MAUDE: https://github.com/sot/kadi/pull/343

#### Commands

The Kadi commands archive files are udpated on HEAD every 10 minutes. However, the
architecture of kadi commands is that commanding within the last 30 days is dynamically
generated based on the Command Events sheet, so ....

### Syncing from HEAD to GRETA

Ska data are synced from HEAD to GRETA each morning at 7:30am local. This finishes
within 15 minutes.

## How to use Ska

### HEAD or GRETA linux

This is simple since everything is pre-installed:
```
source /proj/sot/ska3/flight/bin/ska_envs.csh
```
It is highly recommended that you [create a `ska3`
alias](https://github.com/sot/skare3/wiki/Ska3-runtime-environment-for-users#Linux-alias-for-production-Ska3)
to also update your prompt to indicate that Ska3 is active.

You can quickly check that things are working in the [Testing
Ska3](https://github.com/sot/skare3/wiki/Ska3-runtime-environment-for-users#testing-ska3)
section.

#### Remote access

You can use Ska on your laptop via a remote SSH connection to `chimchim` or a HEAD linux machine with a VS code remote SSH session.
- VS code provides a terminal and Jupyter notebook interface.
- Feels like editing and running in your native OS, but with full access to Ska.
- FOT MP are successfully using this approach.

### Mac or linux laptop

The [user guide for Ska](https://github.com/sot/skare3/wiki/Ska3-runtime-environment-for-users)
gives details for using, installing, and maintaining the Ska runtime environment.

### FOT Windows laptop

Ska is bundled in the FOT MATLAB tools and is used extensively from the MATLAB code.
Using that bundled Ska directly is possible with the right incantations.

## Questions you might have

#### `Ska3` vs `Ska`
- You often see "Ska3", which refers to current Ska with Python 3.
- Legacy Ska using Python 2 installed on HEAD and chimchim for old production scripts.
- For common use, "Ska" is the same as "Ska3".

#### `ska_matplotlib` vs `Ska.Matplotlib` (package names)
- In older code you will see package names like `Ska.Matplotlib` or `Chandra.Time`.
- These "namespace" packages (with the dot) are a legacy of Perl conventions.
- They cause all sorts of problems.
- We have migrated to all lower case with underscores for new code.
- Special case: `Ska.engarchive` => `cheta`. ALWAYS use `cheta` for new code.

#### `CxoTime` vs `DateTime`
- Both classes provide time representation.
- `DateTime` is legacy, based on old C++ code that is not actively maintained.
- `CxoTime` is faster, better, and maintained. ALWAYS use this.
- Simply substituting `DateTime` -> `CxoTime` in older code will generally work, with
  [some caveats](https://sot.github.io/cxotime/#compatibility-with-datetime).

#### Astropy `Table` vs pandas `DataFrame`
- Ska flight packages use only astropy `Table` for tables -> consistency.
- Astropy `Table` supports several key features that are not in `DataFrame`:
  - Multi-dimensional column data, e.g. to store 8x8 pixel ACA images in a table.
  - Metadata in columns and table.
  - Native support for `CxoTime` as a table column.
- Transforming to `DataFrame` is easy with `tbl.to_pandas()`.

#### `Cheta` vs `MAUDE`

These two telemetry servers are *complementary*.

| Cheta | MAUDE |
| -- | -- |
| On-disk data (~225 Gb circa 2025) | Web server backed by data archvie (~Tb's) |
| Back-orbit only, updated daily | Realtime + back-orbit soon after each comm |
| Fetch size limited only by memory |  200,000 points or 3.2MB, per MSID query |
| 20M points/sec | ~200k points/sec |
| Python-only | Python, Javascript (any language really) |
| State codes mostly match TDB (`3TSCMOV`) | State codes strictly match TDB |
| Trailing spaces like `"ON "`, `"OFF"` | No trailing spaces `"ON"`, `"OFF"` |
| Includes certain SI telemetry (ACIS FP, HRC SS) | Does not include SI telemetry |

You can [access MAUDE from
cheta](https://sot.github.io/cheta/fetch_tutorial.html#maude-telemetry-server). Cheta
can even automatically stitch together data from the fast on-archive plus fill in the
most recent available data from MAUDE.

#### `kadi events` vs `kadi commands` vs `kadi states`:

Kadi events are from telemetry and web resources:
- Events in telemetry such as maneuvers, NPM dwells, obsids, mech movements, momentum
  dumps, orbit events, and so forth.
- Events from web resources, for instance CAPs, DSN passes, Load segments, and Chandra
  major events.

Kadi commands:
- Every load command run on-board *or approved*, with a link to source load products.
- Non-load commands which result from either autonomous on-board commanding (e.g.
  SCS-107) or real-time ground commanding (e.g. anomaly recovery).
- Includes predictive commands (expected to happen).
- Kadi commands is *always fresh* by using a combination of data:
  - Archive HDF5 files (synced from HEAD/chimchim at least once / 4 weeks)
  - Live web-accessible resources ([Command Events Google
    sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19d6XqBhWoFjC-z1lS1nM6wLE_zjr4GYB1lOvrEGCbKQ/edit?gid=0#gid=0) + OCCweb for loads)
  - Command Events sheet maintained by FOT MP and normally kept up to date in a timely
    manner.

Kadi states:
- State(s) of Chandra derived from kadi commands.
- Examples include Sun pitch angle, SIM position, ACIS configuration.
- Also predictive.

## Cool things you can do with Ska

### Cheta quaternion comps

This defines the following computed MSIDs based on the corresponding
TDB MSIDs:

- `quat_aoattqt` = `AOATTQT[1-4]`
- `quat_aoatupq` = `AOATUPQ[1-3]`
- `quat_aocmdqt` = `AOCMDQT[1-3]`
- `quat_aotarqt` = `AOTARQT[1-3]`

Example:
```
>>> from cheta import fetch
>>> qatt = fetch.Msid('quat_aoattqt', '2022:001:00:00:00', '2022:001:00:00:04')
>>> qatt.vals
Quat(array([[-0.07434856, -0.55918674, -0.80432653,  0.18665828],
            [-0.07434854, -0.55918679, -0.8043265 ,  0.18665825],
            [-0.07434849, -0.55918674, -0.80432653,  0.18665829],
            [-0.07434849, -0.55918667, -0.80432653,  0.18665852]]))
>>> qatt.vals.equatorial
array([[193.28905806,  19.16894296,  67.36207683],
        [193.28905485,  19.1689407 ,  67.36208471],
        [193.28906329,  19.16893787,  67.36207699],
        [193.28908839,  19.16895134,  67.36206404]])
```

### Make your own kadi states and continuity

```
import kadi.commands.states as kcs

class ERObsidTransition(kcs.ObsidTransition):
    state_keys = ["er_obsid"]
    transition_key = "er_obsid"

    @classmethod
    def get_state_changing_commands(cls, cmds):
        cmds = super().get_state_changing_commands(cmds)
        ok = (cmds["id"] >= 38000) & (cmds["id"] < 60000)
        return cmds[ok]

safing_time = CxoTime("2025:012:14:37:04.000")
er_continuity = kcs.get_continuity(safing_time, state_keys=["er_obsid"])
print(f"continuity er_obsid = {er_continuity['er_obsid']}")
print()

states = kcs.get_states("2025:010", "2025:016", state_keys=["obsid", "er_obsid"])
states["datestart", "obsid", "er_obsid", "trans_keys"].pprint_all()
```
This outputs the following:
```
continuity er_obsid = 42780

      datestart       obsid er_obsid   trans_keys
--------------------- ----- -------- --------------
2025:010:00:00:00.000 30716    42788

2025:015:19:52:40.485 42778    42778 er_obsid,obsid
```

### Grab stuff from OCCweb

The `kadi.occweb` module includes functions for reading OCCweb directories and pages,
as well as iFOT tables.
```
>>> from kadi.occweb import get_ifot, get_occweb_dir, get_occweb_page

>>> get_ifot("ECLIPSE", "2025:001", "2025:030")
<Table length=6>
linenum   id   type_desc         tstart
  str1  int64     str7           str21
------- ------ --------- ---------------------
        947559   Eclipse 2025:016:01:42:50.818
        947560   Eclipse 2025:018:17:10:06.238
        947561   Eclipse 2025:021:08:37:22.600
        947562   Eclipse 2025:024:00:04:42.099
        947563   Eclipse 2025:026:15:32:28.871
        947564   Eclipse 2025:029:07:00:36.082
```
We can get the directory contents of the approved loads in January 2025:
```
>>> get_occweb_dir("FOT/mission_planning/PRODUCTS/APPR_LOADS/2025/JAN")
<Table length=6>
      Name        Last modified   Size
     str16            str16       str1
---------------- ---------------- ----
Parent Directory               --    -
       JAN0325A/ 2025-01-02 14:42    -
       JAN1325A/ 2025-01-10 11:15    -
       JAN1425A/ 2025-01-13 14:52    -
       JAN1525A/ 2025-01-14 11:47    -
       JAN2025A/ 2025-01-17 10:15    -
```

Now let's read the JAN1425A backstop file into a kadi commands table:
```
>>> from kadi.commands import read_backstop
>>> backstop_file = "FOT/mission_planning/PRODUCTS/APPR_LOADS/2025/JAN/JAN1425A/CR014_0305.backstop"
>>> backstop_text = get_occweb_page(backstop_file)
>>> cmds = read_backstop(backstop_text.splitlines())
```
We can print the first 5 commands in a format that looks like backstop:
```
>>> cmds[:5].pprint_like_backstop()
2025:014:02:55:00.000 | LOAD_EVENT       | None       |        0 | event_type=RUNNING_LOAD_TERMINATION_TIME, scs=0
2025:014:03:02:00.000 | ACISPKT          | AA00000000 |        0 | cmds=3, words=3, scs=133
2025:014:03:02:03.000 | ACISPKT          | AA00000000 |        0 | cmds=3, words=3, scs=133
2025:014:03:02:33.000 | COMMAND_SW       | COENASX    |        0 | hex=8448600, msid=COENASX, coenas1=134 , scs=133
2025:014:03:02:33.000 | COMMAND_SW       | CODISASX   |        0 | hex=8458700, msid=CODISASX, codisas1=135 , scs=133
```
